cnping
======

Minimal Graphical IPV4 Ping Tool.  (also comes with searchnet, like nmap but smaller and simpler).  It uses rawdraw so it is (Almost) OS independent.  Someone would have to update ping.h/ping.c.  It takes two parameters... address and time between pings in seconds.  The second is optional.
